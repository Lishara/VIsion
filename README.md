# Vision Mobile APP

## Building from Source with Bazel

1. Follow the [Bazel steps for the TF Demo App](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android#bazel):

  1. [Install Bazel and Android Prerequisites](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android#install-bazel-and-android-prerequisites).
     It's easiest with Android Studio.

      - You'll need at least SDK version 23.
      - Bazel requires Android Build Tools `26.0.1` or higher.
      - You also need to install the Android Support Repository, available
        through Android Studio under `Android SDK Manager -> SDK Tools ->
        Android Support Repository`.

  2. [Edit your `WORKSPACE`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android#edit-workspace)
     to add SDK and NDK targets.

      - Make sure the `api_level` in `WORKSPACE` is set to an SDK version that
        you have installed.
      - By default, Android Studio will install the SDK to `~/Android/Sdk` and
        the NDK to `~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle`.
